## Results

## Challenges 
- Configuring my first github repo
- Loading data
- Defining primary key for some of the tables
- Defining accurate data types for very big numbers. They would not go in the scope of big integer, so I had to make the type as varchar!

## Future Goals
- Driving More complex insights
- Writing More complex SQL functions
- Doing More data cleaning and QA!
